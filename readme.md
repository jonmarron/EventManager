Event Management

An event management company has two kinds of employees: organisers and helpers. For each employee, we know their name. The staff of an event consists of at least 10 helpers, 3 organisers and one of the organisers is assigned as chief organiser. If all conditions are met, the event can start. You cannot start an event without the minimum number of staff.

The company organises the following events:
cocktail parties
weddings
conferences

At cocktail parties, guests can request cocktails from a limited supply. Weddings can only start with a wedding cake. At conferences, guests can ask for a goodie bag, but only one goodie bag per guest.

We want to know the name of the organiser who was the chief organiser for the most events.
